    To start the game they put several black and white pearls in one of the boxes.
    Each robot has <strong>N</strong> moves, after which the initial set is being restored for the next game.
    Each turn, the robot takes a pearl out of the box and puts one of the opposite color back.
    The winner is the one who takes the white pearl on the <strong>Nth</strong> move.
</p>

<p>
    Our robots don't like uncertainty, that's why they want to know the probability of drawing a white pearl on the Nth move.
    The probability is a value between 0 (0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen).
    The result is a float from 0 to 1 with two decimal digits of precision (&plusmn;0.01).
</p>

<p>
    You are given a start set of pearls as a string that contains "b" (black) and "w" (white) and the number of the move
    (N).
    The order of the pearls does not matter.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The start sequence of the pearls as a string and the move number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The probability for a white pearl as a float.

    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio('bbw', 3) == 0.48
checkio('wwb', 3) == 0.52
checkio('www', 3) == 0.56
checkio('bbbb', 1) == 0
checkio('wwbb', 4) == 0.5
checkio('bwbwbwb', 5) == 0.48

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task introduces you to the basics of probability theory and statistics.
    Fun fact: regardless of the initial state, as the number of moves increases, the probability approaches 0.5!
